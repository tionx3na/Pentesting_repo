## Reconnaisance

We use nmap to find out the open ports and the services running on it.

`nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.106`

* We find that there are 3 ports open, 80/tcp , 135/tcp and 445/tcp.
* Service on port 80 is http. version Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
* Service on port 135 is msrpc.
* Service on port 445 is microsoft-ds

After the initial scanning with nmap, I chose to do a port knocking scan to find further information.

### Port KNocking Scan

Port knocking is a method of establishing a connection to a networked computer that has no open ports. Before a connection is established, ports are opened using a port knock sequence, which is a series of connection attempts to closed ports. A remote host generates and sends an authentic knock sequence in order to manipulate the server's firewall rules to open one or more specific ports. These manipulations are mediated by a port knock daemon, running on the server, which monitors the firewall log file for connection attempts that can be translated into authentic knock sequences. Once the desired ports are opened, the remote host can establish a connection and begin a session. Another knock sequence may be used to trigger the closing of the port.

`sudo nmap -sSV -T4 -O -p0-65535 10.10.11.106`


Since there is an http server running, I test that out but was immediately greeted with a login popup. I had to bruteforce it and found that `admin:admin` is the username and passsword.
