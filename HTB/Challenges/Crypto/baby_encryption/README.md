# Baby Encryption -- Crypto Challenge HTB

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:**

You are after an organised crime group which is responsible for the illegal weapon market in your country. As a secret agent, you have infiltrated the group enough to be included in meetings with clients. During the last negotiation, you found one of the confidential messages for the customer. It contains crucial information about the delivery. Do you think you can decrypt it?

# Solution

* The downloaded zip file containes two files in it, *chall.py* and *enc.py*

* We see that *chall.py* is essentially the encryption algorithm and the *msg.enc* is the encrypted message.

* Upon close inspection of *chall.py* file, we see that *ct.append((123 * char + 18) % 256)* is the equation that encrypts the message.

* As we can see that since there is modulo operation is present in the equation it is almost impossible to reverse the equation.

* Another option is to bruteforce the equation inorder to decrypt the message.

* What i did in my solution is to encrypt all the ascii characters and compare it with the encrypted msg to obtain the final decrypted message

* Also noe that, before decrypting necessary conversions from bytes and hex are needed to be done.
